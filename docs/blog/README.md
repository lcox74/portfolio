# Blog

I'm actively trying to blog my projects this year to help me better understand 
the concepts I work, helping me get some sort of consistency on along with 
showing my thought and development process to anyone thats interested.

For 2021 I have a few projects lined up (some are projects I haven't touched in
a while). Each project will have varying difficulty as well as varying in topic.
So I have some sort of check/todo list to go back to, the main projects are:
- **Helios**: Custom Windows Taskbar
- **Izanami**: Unsupervised Learning Trading Bot
- **Greyhound**: 2D Graphics Library
- **Tenjin**: System Emulator (NES, GBA, etc.)
- **Kumo**: HTTP Web Server
- **Tako**: Game Engine
